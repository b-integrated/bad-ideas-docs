  <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: 2/16/2025</p>

  <p>
    Thank you for installing <strong>Bad Ideas</strong> (the “Extension”). 
    We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting it through our compliance with this policy. 
    This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect information that we obtain 
    through the Extension.
  </p>

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <h3>(a) Automatically Collected Information</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information about how you interact with the Extension 
    (e.g., feature usage, error logs) in order to improve its functionality.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Device and Browser Information:</strong> We may collect technical information about your 
    device, operating system, and browser version to ensure compatibility and maintain performance.
  </p>

  <h3>(b) Voluntary Information</h3>
  <p>
    If the Extension allows you to submit or enter information (such as an email address, support requests, 
    or user preferences), we collect whatever you choose to provide.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that this Extension does <strong>not</strong> intentionally collect any personally identifiable 
    information (PII) unless specifically and voluntarily provided by you (e.g., if the Extension requires 
    login or you explicitly grant permission).
  </p>

  <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>To Provide and Maintain the Extension:</strong> Ensuring the Extension functions properly and remains up-to-date.</li>
    <li><strong>To Improve the Extension:</strong> Using aggregated usage data to optimize features, fix bugs, and enhance user experience.</li>
    <li><strong>To Communicate with You:</strong> Sending updates or notices regarding changes to the Extension or to this Privacy Policy, and providing customer support if needed.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We will <strong>not</strong> sell or rent your information to third parties. 
    We will <strong>not</strong> use your information for any other purpose without your consent.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may use trusted third-party services (e.g., analytics, hosting) 
    to help us operate and improve the Extension. These third parties are obligated to keep your 
    information confidential and use it only for the contracted purposes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required to do so by law or in 
    response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
  </p>

  <h2>4. Cookies and Similar Technologies</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension itself typically does not use cookies unless explicitly stated. However, it may interact 
    with cookies if the websites you visit use them. We are not responsible for how other websites handle 
    cookies. For more information, refer to the privacy policy of the respective website.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Your Choices and Controls</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Opt-Out:</strong> If the Extension collects usage analytics, you may disable or remove the 
    Extension at any time to discontinue data collection.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Access and Correction:</strong> If you have provided personal data, you may contact us to 
    request access to, or correction or deletion of, that information (subject to applicable law).
  </p>

  <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We employ reasonable security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, 
    alteration, or disclosure. However, no security measure is perfect, and we cannot guarantee absolute 
    security.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This Extension is not directed toward individuals under the age of 13 (or the age of majority in your 
    jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we may 
    have inadvertently collected data from a child, please contact us so we can remove it.
  </p>

  <h2>8. International Users</h2>
  <p>
    Depending on your location, your information may be transferred to and processed in countries different 
    from where you live. We will take steps to ensure your information is safeguarded according to this 
    Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by the “Last Updated” 
    date at the top of this page. Your continued use of the Extension after these changes indicates your 
    acceptance of the revised policy.
